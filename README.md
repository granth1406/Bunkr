## 📌 Project Description

Bunkr is a web-based tool designed for students to monitor, calculate, and plan their class attendance effectively. It is useful for tracking how many classes you’ve attended and how many you can still afford to miss — making it easier to “bunk” classes responsibly without falling below the minimum attendance requirement.
