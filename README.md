# SCM PROJECT
## Description
A smart attendance tracking system
---

The idea is simply an attendance tracking system. But with a twist it gives count of classes you can bunk to maintain your attendance and how many classes you need to attend if you have below 75%(attendance criteria).

Also it will have many features. A voting system on teachers mood who's taking the class. 

A warning system to send notification to emails or sms If the person attendabec is below the criteria.

A place where a person uploads the image of his timetable and the project understand and send it to backend after processing and show it in graphical view like google calendar 

Also there would be a feature to add dl's, mls for attendance calculation.

And I'm also thinking of adding it woth another project which is anonymous daunt taking project where ina. Class student can ask daunt anonymously through the app and tgere would be an ai in middle who will group the daubt based on topics and show the stats to teacher to understand where students are facing problem nd teacher can have right to fix the topic to group to
