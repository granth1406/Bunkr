  This website is designed for the ones who can't track their attendance. 
  This project includes the attendance calculator and visual representation of our attendance in the form of bar graphs.
  It has also one cool feature that is, it notify you if your attendance is less than 75.
  > Dashboard: Displays total attendance percentage, safe bunk limit, upcoming classes, weekly progress, and current streak.
  > Attendance Entry: Allows manual input of attendance data and synchronization with institutional portals.
  > Bunk Calculator: Helps students determine how many classes they can miss without falling below the required attendance threshold.
  > Reminders & Alerts: Users can enable notifications for upcoming classes or low attendance warnings.
  > Class Schedule Management: Users can add, edit, or remove classes for each day of the week, specifying subjects and timings.
  > Attendance Graphs: Visual representation of attendance trends over time.

  And we also have a game zone where we can chill.
  
  

  It is useful in calculating and tracking your attendace , so you can bunk classes :)
